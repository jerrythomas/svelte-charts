# D3 Charts for Svelte

The core idea behind the implementation is to use the respective strengths of both D3 and Svelte to build Themable, Composable, Animated, Responsive, and Reactive Data Visualization.

- [D3](https://d3js.org/) is a wonderful library for working with SVG that provides large set of utility functions for graph visualization that includes the computation of scales, interpolation, shapes, and more.
- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) is an awesome javascript framework to build user interfaces. Svelte provides modularization, interactivity, reactivity, and responsiveness.
